# 8-bit Microprocessor in Verilog

This project demonstrates a simple, educational 8-bit microprocessor implemented in Verilog and verified through simulation in Vivado. It is built from scratch and showcases how a processor executes instructions using custom components like an ALU, program memory, control logic, and data memory.

## 🧠 Features

- 8-bit word size for instruction and data
- Custom instruction set
- Basic instruction cycle implementation: Fetch → Decode → Execute
- Modular Verilog code for each subsystem
- Vivado project integration for synthesis and simulation

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### Core Components

| Module           | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ALU`            | Performs arithmetic and logical operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR) |
| `PMem`           | Program memory (ROM) containing the instruction set          |
| `DMem`           | Data memory (RAM) for runtime data storage                   |
| `Control_Logic`  | Decodes opcodes and generates control signals                |
| `MUX1`           | Selects between different data inputs                        |
| `adder`          | Used for program counter incrementing                        |
| `top`            | Top-level module connecting all submodules                   |
